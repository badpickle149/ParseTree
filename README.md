Sentential Logic is a way of expressing arguments as formula. Well formed formula of Sentential Logic look like this:

**((AvB)->C)**
**(Av(D->A))**
**((A&C)v(D&E))**

Badly formed formula look like this:

**AvB**
**AvBvC**
**C->DAD**
**((Avb)vC)**
**(AvC**

Capital letters represent statements such as "Bob ate an apple" while other symbols such as "v" and "->" are operators. ParseTree checks to see if a given expression of sentential logic is well formed or not.
